function [qNext, isDone] = potentialFieldStep_groupno(qCurr, map, robot)
% POTENTIALFIELDSTEP_GROUPNO Calculates a single step in a potential field
%   planner based on the virtual forces exerted by all of the elements in
%   map. This function will be called over and over until isDone is set.
%   Use persistent variables if you need historical information. CHANGE 
%   GROUPNO TO YOUR GROUP NUMBER.
%
% INPUTS:
%   qCurr - 1x6 vector representing the current configuration of the robot.
%   map   - a map struct containing the boundaries of the map, any
%           obstacles, the start position, and the goal position.
%   robot - a struct of robot parameters
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   qNext  - 1x6 vector representing the next configuration of the robot
%            after it takes a single step along the potential field.
%   isDone - a boolean flag signifying termination of the potential field
%            algorithm. 
%
%               isDone == 1 -> Terminate the planner. We have either
%                              reached the goal or are stuck with no 
%                              way out.
%               isDone == 0 -> Keep going.
