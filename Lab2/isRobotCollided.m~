function [isCollided] = isRobotCollided(q, map, robot)
% ISROBOTCOLLIDED Detect if a configuration of the Lynx is in collision
%   with any obstacles on the map.
%
% INPUTS:
%   q   - a 1x6 configuration of the robot
%   map - a map strucutre containing axis-aligned-boundary-box obstacles
%   robot - a structure containing the robot dimensions and joint limits
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   isCollided - a boolean flag: 1 if the robot is in collision, 0 if not.
